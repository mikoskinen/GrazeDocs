description: GrazeDocs uses Markdown files as the source and generates the HTML from them.

## Markdown based content

Each documentation page is a Markdown-file. Regular markdown is used to define the content. GrazeDocs then takes the page, combines it with the theme and creates the end result.

## Single-Page Documentation

You can define all your documentation in a single page. GrazeDocs uses the headers of the content to create a table of contents and each header is displayed as a navigation link.

## Multi-Page Documentation

Often it's good to split the documentation into multiple files and into multiple folders. In these situations each page is part of a group and pages can be ordered inside the groups.

## Samples

You can find single-page and multi-page samples from the project's repository: https://github.com/mikoskinen/GrazeDocs/tree/master/samples
